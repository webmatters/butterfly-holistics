      'Working consistently with Valerie is one of the TOP TWO things I did for my business and myself personally... Before seeing Valerie, I was able to work on my mindset and know things intellectually but I was still struggling, so I knew the blocks and areas that needed help were on the subconscious and energetic               level. Valerie helps me clear these blocks so I can fully integrate and be whole and free from all the junk holding me back. I now have a sense of calm, groundedness, and success that Iâ€™ve never experienced before in my life.',

      'I recently attended two workshops with Butterfly Holistics. Valerie is amazing, so knowledgeable about the human body and a healer. Not only did I learn specific skills to incorporate into my massage practice, I also benefited from the work as we practiced during class. I am better for attending, body, mind and spirit and will take more classes from her.',

      "Valerie has truly changed my life through our regular sessions. She is able to help me narrow down what's going on and provides ways to truly heal from the inside out. I always feel supported, heard and connected. With her help I have been able to let go of pain-inducing habits and mindsets and really find myself again. I can't say enough about how much our sessions have truly impacted my life for the better!",
